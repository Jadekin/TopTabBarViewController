# TopTabBarViewController 
*(Still in development)*

**TopTabBarViewController** is UIViewController subclass that helps you to handle two or more child view controllers, and the transitions between them, creating a button bar (according the view controller's title). It is very useful when you have to show subsections in the same view controller, similar to the TabBarViewController.

![Demo for TopTabBarViewController](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jadekin/Jadekin.github.io/master/Projects/Demos/TopBabBarViewController.gif "Demo for TopTabBarViewController")






Objective-C, XCode 8, iOS 10.


## Code Example

1. Add TopTabBarViewController class and Button Bar class to your project.
2. Create UIViewController in Storyboard and setup TopTabBarViewController as a subclass.
3. 
```objectivec
    if ([segue.identifier isEqualToString:@"toTopTabBarViewController"]) {
        
        TopTabBarViewController *topTabBarViewController = segue.destinationViewController;
        
        topTabBarViewController.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];
        
        UIViewController *greenViewController = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"greenViewController"];
        UIViewController *redViewController = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"redViewController"];
        
        topTabBarViewController.topTabBarViewControllers = @[greenViewController, redViewController];
    }
```

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

When I needed to create a list of buttons, the idea to create a N numbers of the in order to handle their actions seems useless because all the constraints I had to set up. In the other hand, just for a couple of buttons, set up a collection view was complicated. So, for that reason, I created Button Bar View.
